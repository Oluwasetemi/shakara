  <p>
    Shakara is a mobile application originally thought out and developed by Uyoyo Sule.
    The idea behind the application is to provide people looking for fashion ideas with a
    central place where they can find nice fashion ideas and get their Nigerian tailors to have them sewn.
    The word Shakara has is attributed to a sense of pride or show-off nature to with intent to
    overshadow others.
